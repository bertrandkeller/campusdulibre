  summary: |-
        The legal obligation is a headache, and is likely to become increasingly restrictive. 

        These constraints (accessibility, digital responsibility, GreenIT, security, data protection, etc.) are designed to drive digital services upmarket. How do you establish this strategy?  

        Get help from an accessibility coach (#A11Y). This coach will help you to understand the legal texts more clearly, keep an eye on think tanks to anticipate new constraints, or train your teams to become autonomous.
